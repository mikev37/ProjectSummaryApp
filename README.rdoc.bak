Employee Project Summary Rails Application Write Up 

What I got working:
•	CRUD version of project summaries to be able to create, read, update, and delete projects
•	Drop downs for specified fields work
•	Show page corresponds to template that Mike and I came up with that we ran through json_resume
•	Links to each part of rails app
What I worked on, but wasn’t able to achieve due to time constraints in figuring it out
•	Couldn’t get nested forms working and spent too many hours trying to fix bugs	 related to get it to work 
	o	i.e. making a “Add another work location” portion of creating a new project and adding the “Prime Contractor” and “Director Customer” when selecting certain ES Role choices
•	For some reason the casing of the labels in the create page of the rails app are off
Also, Alla said Wesley already achieved connecting to the right database and audit trails so I did not complete that either.

Let me know if you have anymore questions about the application.
